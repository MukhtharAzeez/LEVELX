This web application provides a list of characters from the movie "The Lord of the Rings." It offers several features to make it easy for users to navigate and find characters.

## Features

1. **Sorting by Name:** Users can sort the list of characters alphabetically by name, both in ascending and descending order.

2. **Search by Name:** A search bar allows users to search for characters by their names. The search is implemented using the debounce technique, ensuring a smooth and responsive search experience.

3. **Filtering by Gender:** Users can filter characters by gender, allowing them to narrow down the list based on male and female.

4. **Filtering by Race:** Users can also filter characters by their race, such as humans, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and others.

5. **Pagination:** To manage a large list of characters, the application implements pagination, displaying a limited number of characters per page and allowing users to navigate through the pages.
